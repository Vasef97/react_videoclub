# react_videoclub
The Videoclub React app is a front-end interface that displays videoclubs and their movies, allowing users to view, add, update, and delete this information. It seamlessly combines with the videoclub_rest_api, a Spring Boot backend service, by sending HTTP requests to manage videoclub and movie data. The API handles all data persistence, with endpoints for fetching and modifying records, which the React app then displays and updates in real-time.

To run this app please follow these steps:
1. Run the videoclub_rest_api first
2. Navigate to react_videoclub dir
3. npm install
4. npm run dev
5. To access the webpage please visit http://localhost:5173/
